Short Summary:

The code of several components and files that work together to create a web application for managing employee training requests (based on the SF-182 federal employee training request form). The main components include RequestForm, RequestTable, and EmployeeTable. RequestForm is a multi-step form that allows users to submit training requests. It uses Formik and Yup for form validation and handles form submission through an API call.
RequestTable and EmployeeTable are tables that display the submitted training requests and employee information, respectively. They use React Table for table functionality and fetch data from an API endpoint.
The code also includes various helper functions and styling files to customize the appearance and functionality of the web application.

Detailed Summary:

The Federal Employee Training Request Form is a web application built using React, Material React Table, Formik, Yup, and Material-UI. The application includes a multi-step form for submitting training requests, a table for displaying submitted requests, and a table for displaying employee information.
The RequestForm component is a multi-step form that allows users to submit training requests. It uses Formik and Yup for form validation and handles form submission through an API call. The form is divided into several steps, each with its own set of fields. The user can navigate between steps using the "Next" and "Back" buttons. Once the user has completed all the steps, they can submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button.
The RequestTable component is a table that displays the submitted training requests. It uses Material React Table for table functionality and fetches data from an API endpoint. The table includes sorting and filtering functionality, as well as edit and delete functionality for each row.
The EmployeeTable component is a table that displays employee information. It uses Material React Table for table functionality and fetches data from an API endpoint. The table includes sorting and filtering functionality, as well as edit and delete functionality for each row.
The API endpoint is a simple JavaScript object that stores the submitted training requests and employee information as arrays. The endpoint includes methods for Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting (CRUD) data.
The application also includes various helper functions and styling files to customize the appearance and functionality of the web application.
Overall, the Employee Training Request Form is a comprehensive web application that allows users to submit training requests and manage employee information in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
